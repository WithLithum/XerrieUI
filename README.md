# XerrieUI

XerrieUI is a work-in-progress, (currently) Linux-only UI framework inspired
by Windows Forms. It does not require specific native runtime and instead
P/Invoke into XCB and Cairo directly.

This library is work-in-progress, as said above, and should not be used in
production yet.

## Usage

### Demo

A demo app is included in the form of `XerrieUI.Demo` project.
